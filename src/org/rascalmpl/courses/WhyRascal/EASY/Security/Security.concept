.Description
_Alice_ is system administrator of a large online marketplace and she is looking for security breaches in her system. The objects-of-interest are the system's log files. First relevant entries are extracted. This will include, for instance, messages from the SecureShell demon that reports failed login attempts. From each entry login name and originating IP address are extracted and put in a table (the internal representation in this example). These data are analyzed by detecting duplicates and counting frequencies. Finally results are synthesized by listing the most frequently used login names and IP addresses.
