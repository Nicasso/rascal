.Description

A set is a collection of values with the following properties:

*  The set maybe empty.
*  The values in the list are _unordered_.
*  A value can only occur once.
*  The set has a size that is equal to the number of values in the set.


In Rascal, sets are surrounded by braces `{` and `}` and the elements are separated by commas.
Each set has a type of the form `set[_T_]`, where _T_ is the smallest common type of all set elements.
