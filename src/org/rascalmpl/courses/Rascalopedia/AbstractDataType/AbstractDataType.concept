.Description
An http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type[Abstract Data Type] is a mathematical description of a structure
that can be implemented in various ways. For instance, a stack data type can be characterized by `empty` (the empty stack),
two functions `push` and `pop` and axioms that define them. At the implementation level, a stack
can be implemented using a list, array or something else.

In functional languages, and also in Rascal, abstract datatypes (or ADTs for short)
are used to define new data types. Well-known examples are http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure)[stack] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)[tree].
