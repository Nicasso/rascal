.Description

According to the http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syntax[Merriam-Webster] dictionary _syntax_ means

*  the way in which linguistic elements (as words) are put together to form constituents (as phrases or clauses);
*  the part of grammar dealing with this.


http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/syntax[Dictionary.com] is more elaborate and defines _syntax_ as:

*  _Linguistics_:
**  a. the study of the rules for the formation of grammatical sentences in a language.
**  b. the study of the patterns of formation of sentences and phrases from words.
**  c. the rules or patterns so studied: English syntax.
**  d. a presentation of these: a syntax of English.
**  e. an instance of these: the syntax of a sentence.

*  _Computers_:  the grammatical rules and structural patterns governing the ordered use of appropriate words and symbols for issuing commands, writing code, etc., in a particular software application or programming language.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages[Wikipedia] says:  the syntax of a programming language is the
set of rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in that language.

In linguistics, a <<Grammar>> is a concept that includes syntax.
However, in the cases that are relevant for meta-programming they can be used interchangeably.
We will use them as synonyms.

In programming languages a further subdivision can be made:

*  _Lexical syntax_ defines the form of the lowest level textual items such as keywords, numeric constants, and string constants.
*  _Context-free syntax_ defines the global structure of statements, procedures and modules.


A <<Parser>> checks that a text in language _L_ indeed adheres 
to the syntax rules of language _L_. There are two possible answers:

*  _Yes_. A <<ParseTree>> is returned that shows how the text adheres to the syntax rules.
*  _No_. Error messages pin point the location where the text deviates from the syntax rules.
