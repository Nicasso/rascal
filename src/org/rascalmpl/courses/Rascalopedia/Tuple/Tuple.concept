.Description

A tuple is an ordered fixed length sequence of values of possibly different type.

In Rascal a tuple is written as `<` _V_~1~, ..., _V_~n~ `>` and a tuple type has the form `type[_T_~1~, ..., _T_~n~]`,
_T_~i~ represents the type of element _i_. Tuple have two major applications:

*  As tuples in a <<Relation>>.
*  For ad-hoc packaging of values, for instance, to return multiple-values from a function.


See link:/Rascal#Values-Tuple[Tuple Values] for the operations on tuples.
