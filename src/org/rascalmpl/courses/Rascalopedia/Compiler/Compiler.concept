.Description

A http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler[compiler] transforms the source code of a program (in a source langue) to an executable form
(in a target language)
and consists of the following phases:

*  <<Parser>>: read the source code and build an <<Abstract Syntax Tree>>.
*  <<Typechecker>>: perform a semantic analysis of the code, resolve all names
  and verify that the program is type correct.
*  Optimisation: perform optimisations (e.g., constant folding, dead code elimination, call unfolding).
  This can be seen as a form of <<Refactoring>>.
*  Code generation: generate the final code, this can be asembly language or directly executable code.
