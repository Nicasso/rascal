.Description
A language definition defines all relevant aspects of a programming language or <<Domain Specific Language>> and includes:

*  A <<Grammar>> (including lexical and contect-free syntax).
*  Rules to describe the textual formatting of a language. 
  These rules are sufficient to generate a <<Prettyprinter>> for it.
*  Rules that describe the <<Static Semantics>> of a language.
  These rules are sufficient to generate a <<Typechecker>>.
*  Rules that describe the <<Dynamic Semantics>> of a language. 
  These rules are sufficient to generate an <<Interpreter>> for it.
*  Rules how to generate code.


Other aspects of a language definition may include editor behaviour, highlighting, debugging, outlining, auto-completion and more.
