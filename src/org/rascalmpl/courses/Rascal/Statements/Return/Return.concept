.Description
A return statement comes in two variants: without and with an expression,
both variants end the execution of the current function. 
The first variant applies to functions with `void` as return type. 
The second variants applies to non-void functions and returns the value of _Exp_ as result of the function invocation.
The following rules apply:

*  The static type of _Exp_ should be compatible with the declared return type of the function in 
  which the return statement occurs.

*  In each function with a return type that is not void, every possible execution path through the body of 
  the function should end in a return statement.


In each function with a return type that is void, a return statement is implicitly assumed at the end of each execution path through the function body.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
int twice(int n) { return 2 * n; }
twice(5);
----
Functions that only return a value can be abbreviated (and the return is implicit):
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
int twiceb(int n) = 2 * n;
twiceb(5);
