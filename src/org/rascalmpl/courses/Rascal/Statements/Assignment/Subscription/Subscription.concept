.Description
Let _V_ be the current value of _Assignable_. The value of _Exp_~1~ is used as index in _V_ and 
the value of _Exp_~2~ replaces the original value at that index position. 
The result is a new value _V_' that is assigned to the _Assignable_.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
----
Assignable has a list value:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
L = [10,20,30];
P = L;
L[1] = 200;
----
Observe that `P` is unchanged:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
P;
----
Assignable has a map value:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
M = ("abc": 1, "def" : 2);
M["def"] = 3;
----
Assignable has a tuple value:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
T = <1, "abc", true>;
T[1] = "def";
