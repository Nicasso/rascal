.Description

First the value of _Exp_~1~ is determined and if that is defined it is assigned to _Assignable_. 
Otherwise, the value of _Exp_~2~ is assigned to _Assignable_. 
Values which can be undefined are values in <<Map>>s where the key is not set 
or values of <<Annotation Declaration,Annotations>> which have not been set yet. 

No other values can be used in an undefined state, so the ? operator does not make sense on undefined or uninitialized variables for example.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
M = ("Andy": 1, "Brian" : 2);
----
Using an `isDefined` assignable can we increment a non-existing entry:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
M["SomebodyElse"] ? 0 += 1;
M["SomebodyElse"];
----
And if we increment an existing entry the ? has no effect:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
M["Andy"] ? 0 += 1;
M["Andy"]
----
