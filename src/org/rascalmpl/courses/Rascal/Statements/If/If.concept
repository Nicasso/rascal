.Function

.Details

.Description
The test _Exp_ is evaluated and its outcome determines the statement to be executed: 
_Statement_~1~ if _Exp_ yields `true` and _Statement_~2~ otherwise. 
The value of an if-then statement is equal to _Statement_ when its test is true. Otherwise it is void.
The value of an if-then-else statement is the value of the statement that was executed.

.Examples

----
if( 3 > 2 ) 30; else 40;
x = if( 3 > 2 ) 30; else 40;
if( 3 > 2 ) 30;
----
An if-then statement yields `void`  when its test is false
(demonstrated by the __ok__ that is printed by the Rascal system):
