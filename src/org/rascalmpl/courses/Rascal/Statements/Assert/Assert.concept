.Details

.Description
An assert statement may occur everywhere where a declaration is allowed. It has two forms:

An assert statement consists of a Boolean expression _Exp_~1~ and an optional string expression _Exp_~2~
that serves as a identifying message for this assertion. 

When _Exp_~1~ evaluates to `false`, an `AssertionFailed` exception is thrown.

.Examples

  assert y != 0 : "y must be non-zero";
  return x / y;
