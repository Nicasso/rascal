.Description
A throw statement causes the immediate abortion of the execution of the current function with _Exp_ \'s value as exception value.
The exception can be caught by a <<Try Catch>> statement in the current function or in one of its callers.
If the exception is not caught, the execution of the Rascal program is terminated. The following rules apply:

*  The static type of _Exp_ should be `RuntimeException`, see link:/Libraries#Exception-RuntimeException[RuntimeException].

*  The Rascal program may contain data declarations that extend the type `RuntimeException`.

.Examples
Here is a a variant of string concatenation for ball haters:
[source,rascal-shell,error]
----
str conc(str x, str y){ if("ball" in {x, y}) throw "I hate balls"; return x + y; }
conc("fairy", "tale");
conc("foot", "ball");
