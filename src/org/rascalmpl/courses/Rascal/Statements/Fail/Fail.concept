.Description
A `fail` statement is only allowed in statements that are controlled by the outcome of a pattern match:

*  The <<Patterns>> in a <<Pattern with Action>> in <<Switch>> or <<Visit>> statement controls the statements in the action part.
*  The test (expression) of a <<While>> or <<Do>> statement controls the statements in the body part.
*  The test (expressions) of a <<For>> statement control the statements in the body part.
*  The formal parameter declaration of a <<Function Declaration>>.


The `fail` statement is associated with the innermost pattern match by which it is controlled.

When `fail` is executed:

*  If the associated pattern has more alternatives, the next alternative is explored,
*  otherwise the pattern as a whole fails. 
   ** In the case of switch or visit this means that the next case will be tried.
   ** For while, do and for, this implies that any bindings caused by the pattern are undone and that the next 
      alternative in the test is tried; otherwise the loop is terminated.
   ** For a function call it means that the next function declaration (or the default one) is tried.

.Examples

Here is an example taken from link:/Recipes#Bubble[Bubble]. 
It uses a `fail` for the case that no unsorted element can be found in the list of numbers.
As a result, the whole case fails and the default case is used.

import IO;
public list[int] sort(list[int] numbers){
  switch(numbers){
    case [*int nums1, int p, int q, *int nums2]:
       if(p > q){
          return sort(nums1 + [q, p] + nums2);
       } else {
       	  fail;
       }
     default: return numbers;
   }
}
sort([10, 1, 5, 3]);
