.Description
A descendant pattern
performs a deep match of the pattern _Pat_. In other words, it matches when any element of the subject at any depth
that matches _Pat_ and is used to match, for instance, tree nodes at an arbitrary distance from the root.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
import IO;
data ColoredTree = leaf(int N)
                 | red(ColoredTree left, ColoredTree right) 
                 | black(ColoredTree left, ColoredTree right);
T = red(red(black(leaf(1), leaf(2)), black(leaf(3), leaf(4))), black(leaf(5), leaf(4)));
----
Now we match for `black` nodes with `leaf(4)` as second argument:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
for(/black(_,leaf(4)) := T)
    println("Match!");
----
We use an __anonymous variable__ `_` at a position where we don't care about the actual value that is matched.
In order to print the actual values of the matches, we would need an [Abstract/Labelled] pattern.

Here we match all leaves that occur as second argument of `black`:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
for(/black(_,leaf(int N)) := T)
    println("Match <N>");
----
Here we list all integers that occur in any leaf:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
for(/int N := T)
    println("Match <N>");
----
Rather than printing, we can also collect them in a list using [$Statements/Append]:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
for(/int N := T)
    append N;
