.Synopsis
Greater than operator on values.

.Syntax
`_Exp_~1~ > _Exp_~2~`

.Types


|====
| `_Exp~1~_` | `_Exp~2~_` | `_Exp~1~_ > _Exp~2~_`

| `value`   |  `value`  | `bool`

.Details

.Description
By brute force, a total less than operator between two values _V_~1~ and _V_~2~ of arbitrary types _T_~1~ and _T_~2~ is defined:

*  If the types _T~1~_ and _T~2~_ can be compared then _V~1~_ less than _V~2~_ is used.

*  Otherwise values are ordered according their type name, for instance, `int` is smaller than `list`, and `map` is smaller than `rel`.


Greater than yields `true` if the value of _Exp_~2~ is strictly less
than (according to the ordering defined above) the value of _Exp_~1~, and `false` otherwise.

.Examples

Introduce two variables `X`, `Y` and `Z` and force them to be of type `value`:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
value X = "def";
value Y = "abc";
value Z = 3.14;
----
Now compare `X` and `Y`:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
X > Y;
----
and `X` and `Z`:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
X > Z;
----
