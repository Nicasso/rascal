# Location

.Synopsis
(Source code) location values.

.Index
| ( )

.Syntax
`| _Uri_ | ( _O_, _L_, < _BL_, _BC_ > , < _EL_,_EC_ > )`
where:

*  _Uri_ is an arbitrary Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

*  _O_ and _L_ are integer expressions giving the offset of this location to the begin of file, respectively, its length.

*  _BL_ and _BC_ are integers expressions giving the begin line and begin column.

*  _EL_ and _EC_ are integers expressions giving the end line and end column.


The part following the second pipe symbol (`|`) is optional.


.Types
`loc`

.Function

.Details

.Description
Location values are represented by the type `loc` and serve the following purposes:

*  Providing a uniform mechanism for accessing local or remote files. This is used in all IO-related library functions.
*  If the optional part is present they serve as text coordinates in a specific local or remote source file.
  This is very handy to associate a source code location which extracted facts.


URIs are explained in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier[Uniform Resource Identifier]. From their original definition in RFC3986 we cite the following useful overview of an URI:
[source,rascal]
----

         foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
         \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |            |        |
       scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
          |   _____________________|__
         / \ /                        \
         urn:example:animal:ferret:nose

The elements of a location value can be accessed and modified using the standard mechanism of field selection and field assignment. The corresponding field names are:

*  `top`: the URI of the location without precise positioning information (offset, length, begin, end).

*  `uri`: the URI of the location as a string. Also subfields of the URI can be accessed:

** `scheme`: the scheme (or protocol) to be used;

** `authority`: the domain where the data are located, as a `str`;

** `host`: the host where the URI is hosted (part of authority), as a `str`;

** `port`: port on host (part of authority), as a `int`;

** `path`: path name of file on host, as a `str`;

** `extension`: file name extension, as a `str`;

** `query`: query data, as a `str`;

** `fragment`: the fragment name following the path name and query data, as a `str`;

** `user`: user info (only present in schemes like mailto), as a `str`;
  
** `parent` : removes the last segment from the path component, if any, as a `loc`;

** `file` : the last segment of the path, as a `str`;

** `ls` : the contents of a directory, if the loc is a directory, as a `list[loc]`.

* `offset`: start of text area.

* `length`: length of text area.

* `begin.line`, `begin.column`: begin line and column of text area.

* `end.line`, `end.column` end line and column of text area.


Supported protocols are:

|====
| Scheme name and pattern | Description

| `http://_host_:_port_/_path_?_query_#_fragment_`      | access a remote file via the web.
| `file:///_path_`                                      | access a local file on the file system.
| `cwd:///_path_`                                       | access the current working directory (the directory from which Rascal was started).
| `home:///_path_`                                      | access the home directory of the user.
| `std:///_path_`                                       | access the Rascal standard library. 
| `tmp:///_path_`                                       | access the temporay file directory. 
| `jar:_url_!/[_entry_]`                                | access any entry in a zip file (or a jar) 
| `rascal://_qualifiedModulename_`                      | access the source code of a Rascal module name 
| `project://_projectName_/_projectRelativePath_`       | access a project in the current instance of Eclipse. 
| `bundleresource://_bundleId_/_bundleRelativePath_`    | access OSGI bundles. Only active in Eclipse context

.Examples
Locations with specific position information should always be generated automatically but for the curious here is an example:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
|file:///home/paulk/pico.trm|(0,1,<2,3>,<4,5>)
----
Note that this is equivalent to using the `home` scheme:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
|home://pico.trm|(0,1,<2,3>,<4,5>)
----

Accessing a file `src/HelloWorld.java` in a project with the name `example-project` in the currently running Eclipse is done as follows:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
|project://example-project/src/HelloWorld.java|
----


You could read a webpage:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
import IO;
println(readFile(|http://www.example.org|))
----

Addition on locations creates longer paths:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
x = |tmp://myTempDirectory|;
x += "myTempFile.txt";
----

Check the contents of a folder:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
|project://example-project/src|.ls
----
