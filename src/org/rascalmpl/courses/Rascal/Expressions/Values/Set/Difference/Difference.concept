.Details

.Description
If both _Exp_~1~ and _Exp_~2~ have a set as value, the result is the difference of these two set values. 
If _Exp_~2~ does not have a set as value, it is first converted to a set before the difference is computed.
The difference is computed by removing all elements of the second set from the first set.
