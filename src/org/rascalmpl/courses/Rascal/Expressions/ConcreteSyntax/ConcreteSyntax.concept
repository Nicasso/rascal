.Syntax

*  `(_Nonterminal_) `_sentence_``
*  ` `_sentence_` `


where each sentence is a string over the language generated from `_Nonterminal_`. This language is extended in the following way. Each non-terminal reachable `X` from _Non_-terminal has an added alternative to allow nested Rascal <<Patterns>> inside of concrete syntax fragments:

*  `syntax X = "<" Pattern p ">";`

.Description
A concrete syntax fragment allows the programmer to write patterns and expressions in the language that is currently analyzed, 
transformed or generated. The <<Concrete Syntax>> feature is derived from <<Syntax Definition>>s. 
For any non-terminal defined in a <<Syntax Definition>>, you may use <<Concrete Syntax>> to match or generate its parse trees.

.Examples

.Benefits

*  Easy notation for complex structures

.Pitfalls

*  Since Rascal currently has no type-checker, the disambiguation of concrete syntax fragments is done heuristically which may lead to surprises.
*  The disambiguation of embedded concrete syntax fragments may change in the near future.
