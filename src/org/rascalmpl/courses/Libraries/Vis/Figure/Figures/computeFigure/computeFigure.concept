.Details

.Description
Return the figure that is returned by the callback `computeFig`.

Subsequent calls to `computeFig` may return different figures and may thus change the resulting visualization.
The figure is recomputed after each user interaction.

Optionally, a function `recomp` may be given that checks whether the figure should be recomputed.
