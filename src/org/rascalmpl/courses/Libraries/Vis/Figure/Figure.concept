.Description
The Figure library provides visualization functionality that
can be used to synthesize information. 
This plays, for example, a role in the synthesis part of the link:/EASY[EASY] paradigm.
It is based on the following principles:

*  __Coordinate free__: only intrinsic properties of figures such as their height, width or color have to be specified. 
  Their placement and actual coordinates are computed automatically.
*  __Compositional__: figures can be composed in many ways.
*  __Declarative__: the definition of a figure does not has any side-effects like, for example, 
  changing the current drawing location or current drawing color.
*  __Scalable__: the dimensions of figures can be scaled automatically.


More precisely, figures:

*  ... are ordinary values that can be computed and manipulated, e.g., by functions.
*  ... only describe their own properties like dimensions and color.
*  ... are unaware of their actual coordinate position.
*  ... can be composed with other figures. Examples are horizontal and vertical composition, 
  placement on a grid, graph or tree.
*  ... can be reused in different contexts.


The Figure library provides two data types:

*  `FProperty` describes a property of a figure such as (also see [Properties]):
**  _Sizing_: [$Properties/size], [hsize] (or [width]), [vsize] (or [height]). 
**  _ Positioning_: [align], [gap], [textAngle].
**  _Visual appearance_: [lineWidth], [lineColor], [lineStyle], [fillColor], [font], [fontSize], [fontColor], [shadow], [shapeConnected],
     <<shapeClosed>>, <<shapeCurved>>.
**  _Interaction_: [resizable], [onClick], [onKeyDown], [onKeyUp], [onMouseEnter], [onMouseExit], [onMouseDown], [onMouseUp], 
     <<onClick>>, <<onMouseMove>>.
**  _Other_: [id]

*  `Figure` describes an actual visual element such as (also see [Figures]):
**  _Atomic Figures_: [$Figures/text], [$Figures/outline].
**  _Containers_: [box], [ellipse], [space].
**  _Compositions_: [hcat], [vcat], [hvcat], [overlay], [pack], [grid], [$Figures/tree], [treemap], [$Figures/graph].
**  _Transformations_: [$Figures/scale], [rotate].

.Examples

.Benefits

.Pitfalls
One of the functions <<Render-render>> or <<Render-renderSave>> are needed to actually view a Figure.
