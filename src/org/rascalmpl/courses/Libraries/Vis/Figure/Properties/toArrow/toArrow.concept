.Details

.Description
Add an arrow to the destination of a <<Figures-graph>> edge. 
The arrow is an arbitrary figure `f` and its upper side will be used as the
point of the arrow. The figure is appropriately rotated depending on the orientation of the edge.

An arrow to the source of an edge is defined with <<fromArrow>>.
An edge may have both a <<fromArrow>> and a <<toArrow>> property.
