.Description
The Figure library uses the following model for the composition of figures:

The ingredients are:

*  [Properties/size] determines the _minimal_ horizontal and vertical size of a figure. Sizes can be set separately per dimension using [hsize] (synonym [width]) or [vsize] (synonym: [height]). Figures can never become smaller than their minimal size.
*  [shrink] determines how much smaller a figure is relative to its parent size. Shrink can also be set per dimension using [hshrink] or [vshrink].
*  [grow] determines how much larger a figure is relative to its child size. Grow can also be set per dimension using [hgrow] or [vgrow].
*  [align] determines the alignment of a figure relative to its parent. Alignment can also be set per dimension using [halign] or [halign].


A number of shorthands is provided for common alignment values:


|====
| Shorthand   | Corresponds to     | See                  |
|:------------|:-------------------|:---------------------|
| `left()`    | `halign(0.0)`     | [Properties/left]    |
| `hcenter()` | `halign(0.5)`     | [Properties/hcenter] |
| `right()`   | `halign(1.0)`     | [Properties/right]   |
| `top()`     | `valign(0.0)`     | [Properties/top]     |
| `vcenter()` | `valign(0.5)`     | [Properties/vcenter] |
| `bottom()`  | `valign(1.0)`     | [Properties/bottom]  |
| `center()`  | `align(0.5, 0.5)` | [Properties/center]  |
|====



The following units are used:

*  sizes are expressed in pixels, i.e., screen points.
*  align, grow and shrink are expressed as percentage of width and/or height and have a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

.Benefits

.Pitfalls

*  Although sizes are traditionally used to determine the size of geometric figures, it is better to use relative sizes using `grow`, `shrink` and `align` since this makes figures resizable.

*  [resizable] can be used to control the resizing behaviour of a figure.
