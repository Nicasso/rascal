.Description
A color is expressed in the RGB color space and consists of a red, green and blue
ingredient; each can have a value in the range [0-255].
In addition, colors can have a transparency, expressed as a percentage
between 0.0 (completely opaque) and 1.0 (completely transparent).
One can also refer to colors by name. The full range of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#X11_color_names[X11 (HTML) Colors]
is supported.

A color can be constructed using:

*  the integer value of the color (RGBA, 8 bits per color)
*  the [rgb] function that combines the red, green and blue ingredient into an integer representation of the color.
*  the [color] function that maps color names to color values.
*  the [gray] function that creates gray scale values.
#  the [arbColor] function that creates an arbitrary color.


The following properties use colors:

*  [lineColor]: sets the color of lines and borders.
*  [fillColor]: sets the color for filling the inside of a figure.
*  [fontColor]: sets the color for text.


all these properties accept a Color value or, for convenience, also a color name.

.Examples
[source,rascal-figure,width=,height=,file=b1.png]
----
                b1 = box([size(50), fillColor("MidNightBlue")]);
render(b1);
----

displays: 
image::{concept}/b1.png[alt="b1"]


We can also use the RGB value of MidNightBlue directly
[source,rascal-figure,width=,height=,file=b2.png]
----
                b2 = box([size(50), fillColor(rgb(25,25,112))]);
render(b2);
----
and obtain (unsurprisingly) the same result: 
image::{concept}/b2.png[alt="b2"]
