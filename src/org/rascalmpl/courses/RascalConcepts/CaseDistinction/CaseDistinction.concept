.Description
The switch statement as known from C and Java is generalized: the subject value to switch on may be an 
arbitrary value and the cases are arbitrary patterns followed by a statement. 
Each case is comparable to a _transaction_: when the pattern succeeds and the following statement is 
executed successfully, all changes to variables made by the statement are committed and thus become permanent. 
The variables bound by the pattern are always local to the statement associated with the case. 

See link:/Rascal#Statements-Switch[Switch],link:/Rascal#Expressions-Visit[Visit] and 
link:/Rascal#Patterns-PatternWithAction[Pattern With Action] for more details.

.Examples
We use the link:/Recipes#Common-ColoredTrees[ColoredTrees] datatype as example and use a switch to
distinguish between red and black nodes:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
data ColoredTree = 
      leaf(int N) 
    | red(ColoredTree left, ColoredTree right) 
    | black(ColoredTree left, ColoredTree right);
ColoredTree CT = red(black(leaf(1), red(leaf(2),leaf(3))), black(leaf(3), leaf(4)));
import IO;
switch (CT){
case red(_, _):
     println("A red root node");
case black(_, _):
     println("A black root node");
}
