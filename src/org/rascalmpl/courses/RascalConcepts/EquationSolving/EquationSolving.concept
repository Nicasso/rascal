.Description
Many problems can be solved by forms of _constraint solving_. 
This is a declarative way of programming: specify the constraints that a problem solution should 
satisfy and how potential solutions can be generated. 
The actual solution (if any) is found by enumerating solutions and testing their compliance with the constraints.

Rascal provides a link:/Rascal#Statements-Solve[Solve] statement that helps writing constraint solvers. 

.Examples
A typical example is data flow analysis where the propagation of values through a program can be described by a set of equations. 
Their solution can be found with the solve statement.
