.Description
Rascal provides a rich set of datatypes:

*  link:/Rascal#Values-Boolean[Boolean] (`bool`).
*  Infinite precision link:/Rascal#Values-Integer[Integer] (`int`), 
   link:/Rascal#Values-Real[Real] (`real`), and link:/Rascal#Values-Number[Number] (`num`).
*  link:/Rascal#Values-String[String]s (`str`) that can act as templates with embedded expressions and statements. 
*  Source code link:/Rascal#Values-Location[Location]s (`loc`) based on an extension of Universal Resource Identifiers (URI) that allow precise description of text areas in local and remote files.
*  Date and time values (link:/Rascal#Values-DateTime[DateTime], `datetime`).
*  link:/Rascal#Values-List[List] (`list`).
*  link:/Rascal#Values-Tuple[Tuple] (`tuple`).
*  link:/Rascal#Values-Set[Set] (`set`).
*  link:/Rascal#Values-Map[Map] (`map`) 
*  link:/Rascal#Values-Relation[Relation] (`rel`). 
*  Untyped tree structures (link:/Rascal#Values-Node[Node], `node`).  
*  User-defined algebraic datatypes (link:/Rascal#Declarations-AlgebraicDataType[Algebraic Data Type], `data`) allow the introduction of problem-specific types and are a subtype of node. 
  This makes it possible to have typed
  and untyped views on the same data. 
  A special case are syntax trees that are the result of parsing source files are represented 
  as datatypes (`Tree`).


There is a wealth of built-in operators and library functions available on the standard datatypes. 

These built-in datatypes are closely related to each other:

*  In a list all elements have the same static type and the order of elements matters. A list may contain the same value more than once.
*  In a set all elements have the same static type and the order of elements does not matter.
  A set contains an element only once. In other words, duplicate elements are eliminated 
  and no matter how many times an element is added to a set, it will occur in it only once.
*  In a tuple all elements (may) have a different static type. Each element of a tuple may have a label that can be used to select that  
  element of the tuple.
*  A relation is a set of tuples which all have the same static tuple type.
*  A map is an associative table of (key, value) pairs. Key and value (may) have different static 
  type and a key can only be associated with a value once.

.Examples
Here are some examples of the built-in data types:
|====
| _Type_                    | _Examples_

| `bool`                    | `true`, `false`
| `int`                     | `11, 101, 1-11, 1123456789`
| `real`                    | `1.01, 11.0232e201, 1-25.5`
| `str`                     | `"abc"`, `"first\nnext"`, `"result: <X>"`
| `loc`                     | `\|file:///etc/passwd\|`
| `dateTime`                | `$2101-09-05T07:16:19.714+0200$`
| `tuple[_T~1~,...,_T~n~_]`	| `<1,2>`, `<"john", 43, true>`
| `list[_T_]`               | `[]`, `[1]`, `[1,2,3]`, `[true, 2, "abc"]`
| `set[_T_]`                | `{}`, `{1,2,3,5,7}`, `{"john", 4.0}`
| `rel[_T~1~,...,_T~n~_]`   | `{<1,2>,<2,3>,<1,3>}`, `{<1,10,100>, <2,20,200>}`
| `map[_T_, _U_]`           | `()`, `(1:true, 2:false)`, `("a":1, "b":2)`
| `node`                    | `f()`, `add(x,y)`, `g("abc", [2,3,4])`
|====

A fragment of the datatype that defines the abstract syntax for statements (assignment, if, while) in a programming language would look as follows:

[source,rascal]
----
data STAT = asgStat(Id name, EXP exp)
          | ifStat(EXP exp,list[STAT] thenpart,
                           list[STAT] elsepart) 
          | whileStat(EXP exp, list[STAT] body)
          ;
----

Here are some examples how Rascal responds to values of the above built-in datatypes:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
true;
101;
3.14;
"Rascal";
|file:///etc/passwd|;
$2101-09-05$;
[30, 20, 10];
<"Rascal", 100000>;
{"apples", "oranges", "bananas"};
{<"apples", 10, 15>, <"oranges", 5, 7>, <"bananas", 9, 11>};
("apples" : 100, "oranges": 150, "bananas": 75);
"abc"(1, 2, 3);
