# Syntax Definition and Parsing

.Synopsis
Syntax definition and parser generation for new languages.

.Description

All source code analysis projects need to extract information directly from the source code. 
There are two main approaches to this:

*  _Lexical information_: Use regular expressions to extract useful, but somewhat superficial, flat, information. 
   This can be achieved using regular expression patterns, 
   see link:/Rascal#Patterns-Regular[Regular Expression Pattern]s.
*  _Structured information_: Use syntax analysis to extract the complete, nested, structure of the source code 
   in the form of a syntax tree. Rascal can directly manipulate the parse trees, but it also enables user-defined
   mappings from parse tree to abstract syntax tree.


Using link:/Rascal#Declarations-SyntaxDefinition[Syntax Definitions] you can define the syntax of any (programming) language. Then Rascal:

*  will generate the parser, and
*  will provide pattern matching and pattern construction on parse trees and abstract syntax trees,
   see link:/Rascal#Patterns-Abstract[Abstract Patterns] and    
  link:/Rascal#Patterns-Concrete[Concrete Patterns].

.Examples
Let's use the Exp language as example. It contains the following elements:

*  Integer constants, e.g., `123`.
*  A multiplication operator, e.g., `3*4`.
*  An addition operator, e.g., `3+4`.
*  Multiplication is left-associative and has precedence over addition.
*  Addition is left-associative.
*  Parentheses can be used to override the precedence of the operators.

Here are some examples:

*  `123`
*  `2+3+4`
*  `2+3*4`
*  `(2+3)*4`


The EXP language can be defined as follows:

[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/lang/Exp/Concrete/WithLayout/Syntax.rsc[tags=module]
----

                
Now you may parse and manipulate programs in the EXP language. Let's demonstrate parsing an expression:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
import demo::lang::Exp::Concrete::WithLayout::Syntax;
import ParseTree;
parse(#start[Exp], "2+3*4");
----

First we import the syntax definition and the link:/Libraries/Prelude-ParseTree[ParseTree] module that provides the parsing functionality.
Finally, we parse `2+3*4` using the start symbol `Exp`.

Don't be worried, we are just showing the resulting parse tree here. It intended for programs and not for humans.
The points we want to make are:

*  Rascal grammars are relatively easy to read and write (unfortunately, writing grammars will never become simple).
*  Parser generation is completely implicit.
*  Given a syntax definition, it can be used immediately for parsing.
