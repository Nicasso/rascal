.Description

You can use any of Rascal's link:/Rascal#Expressions-Values[Values] to represent facts about source code. 
For example, link:/Rascal#Declarations-AlgebraicDataType[Algebraic Data Types] can be used to define 
abstract syntax trees and <<Values-Relation>> are used to represent call graphs. 
We consistently use link:/Rascal#Values-Location[Locations] to refer to source code artifacts, 
either physically (`|file:///tmp/HelloWorld.java|`) or logically (`|java+class://java/lang/Object|`).

Specifically we have standardized a set of models to represent source code which are ready 
for computing metrics: #/Libraries#analysis-m3[M3]. This M3 model consists of: 

*  an open (extensible) set of link:/Rascal#Values-Relation[Relations] between source code artifacts.
*  a number of extensible link:/Rascal#Declarations-AlgebraicDataType[Algebraic Data Types]
  for representing abstract syntax trees. 


The core language independent model can be found here: link:/Libraries#analysis-m3[analysis::m3].

Extensions for representing facts about specific languages:

*  link:/Libraries#java-m3[lang::java::m3].
