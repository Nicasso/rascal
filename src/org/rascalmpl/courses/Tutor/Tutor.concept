.Description
The RascalTutor is an interactive <<Authoring>> and learning environment intended to create and follow interactive courses related to the Rascal language.
It is based on the following principles and ideas:

*  The basic notion is a [Concept]. Each concept has a _name_ and contains a fixed set of subsections that describe it.
*  A course is a _concept tree_:
  The central subject of the course is the root of the concept tree, and all subtrees further explain their parent concept.


A _student_ using a course can:

*  Browse through a tree structured overview of the concept tree of the course.
*  Search for concepts and specific terms using a search box.
*  Read individual concepts.
*  Follow links to other concepts.
*  Perform any exercises that are available.


An _author_ of a course can:

*  Edit a concept directly using a wiki-like form of [Markup] that makes it easy to create good looking concept pages.
*  Add code examples that are actually executed when the concept is turned into an HTML page.
*  Add interactive exercises.
*  Save a concept after editing: this will recompile that concept only, but eill update the gloabl search idnex, global warnings, and the like.
*  Recompile all concepts in the whole course.
*  Inspect the warnings that are generated for a concept or for the whole course in order to 
  control the quality of the concept descriptions.
