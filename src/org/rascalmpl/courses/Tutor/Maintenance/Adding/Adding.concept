.Description

There are basically two scenarios for adding a new concept, depending on where its contents come from.
If the concept is going to be completely contained in the course itself:

*  Select a concept that is suitable as parent for the new concept:
*  Click the `New Subconcept` button.
*  An editing windows is opened: add the name and other information about the new concept.
*  Press the `Save` button. The new concept is now part of the course.


If the concept involves remote content (i.e., the concepts are described in rascallibrary files),
then a <<ConceptMapping>> has to be added as explained in <<SourceCodeMarkup>>.
