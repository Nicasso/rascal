.Description
There is no built-in mechanism for renaming a concept. The manual steps to be taken to rename a concept _C_ to _D_ 
are therefore:

*  Goto to the relevant subdirectory of `org/rascalmpl/courses` and locate the concept directory $C$ to be renamed.
*  Rename $C$ to $D$ using the commands of the version control system.
*  Rename $D$`/`$C$`.concept` to $D$`/`$D$`.concept` using the version control system.
*  Open $D$`/`$D$`.concept` in a text editor and change the line `Name: $C$` to `Name: $D$`.
*  Recompile the course.
