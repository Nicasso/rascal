.Description
The first form creates a link to a concept in the current course.
The conceptname may be:

*  A full pathname of a concept.
*  A partial pathname (with elements starting at the rooted omitted)
*  A basic conceptname, i.e. the name fo a concept without its hierarchical path.


A partial concept name may be needed if the course contains concepts with the same
name in different parts of the concept hierarchy.

The second form creates a link to a concept in another course.

Each of these two forms may be preceeded by a `$` sign (mnemonic: _short_) and has as effect that only the most specific part of the conceptname is shown.

.Examples
We can create a reference to the `InlineMarkup` concept in the current course in the following ways:

*  `[Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup]` gives [Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup].
*  `[$Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup]` gives [$Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup].
*  `[Markup/InlineMarkup]` gives [Markup/InlineMarkup].
*  `[InlineMarkup]` gives [InlineMarkup].
*  `[Rascal:If]` gives [Rascal:If].
*  `[Rascal:Rascal]` gives [Rascal:Rascal].
