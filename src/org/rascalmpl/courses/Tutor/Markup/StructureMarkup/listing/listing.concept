.Details

.Description
A listing shows Rascal code without executing it. A listing can be of the following kinds:

#  _inline_: the Rascal code appears between the `<listing>` and `</listing>` brackets.
#  _file_: the Rascal code is copied from a named file.
  To avoid that lengthy legal information, contributor lists, and the like appear
  in the listings in the course, all lines occuring before a line containing `//START` are removed before inclusion.
  If such a line is missing, the complete file is included.

.Examples
The input:<br>

`<listing>`<br>
`x = 3;`<br>
`</listing>`

will produce:

[source,rascal]
----
x = 3;
----

The input:<br>
`<listing demo/Hello.rsc>`

will produce.
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/basic/Hello.rsc[]
----

                
Compared with the source file, all lines before `//START` have been removed.

.Benefits

.Pitfalls
Do not make the lines in a listing too long since they will not be wrapped.
Not more than 60 characters is a rule of thumb.
