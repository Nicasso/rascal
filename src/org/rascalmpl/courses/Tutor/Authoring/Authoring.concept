.Description
The life cycle of a course consists of the following steps:

#  A new course is created and added to the `index.html` file of the Tutor (this is at the moment a manual step).
  The new course consists of one root concept.
#  New subconcepts are created and modified in order to build the full contents of the course.


Each concept page contains at the bottom a number of buttons to enable this authoring process:

*  __New subconcept__ creates a subconcept of the current concept. This will also update the [Details] of the current concept.
*  __Edit__ allows editing of the current concept. After saving the modified concept,
a new HTML page will be generated for it.

*  __Recompile Course__ compiles _all_ concepts in the course.
*  __Warnings__ show a list of all warnings and error messages that were produced during the last (re)compilation of the
whole course.


After *New Subconcept* and *Edit* the following  course information is updated:

*  The navigation panel.
*  The search index.
*  The warnings.


As a result, the Tutor is completely up-to-date after each edit operation or concept creation.

In addition, *Recompile Course* generates new HTML pages for all concepts before updating the above information.
Recompilation is only necessary to verify that all `<screen>`s and `<figure>`s execute without generating warnings.

.Examples

.Benefits

.Pitfalls

*  Authoring is only enabled when the Tutor is running as a SVN checkout.
*  When a new subconcept is created it immediately appears in its parent. You to do _Compile Course_ to update the navigation pane as well.
When you are using a deployed Rascal Eclipse plugin, the abovementioned buttons will not be available.

*  There is currently no support for renaming/removing/moving concepts. This has to be done at the command line using SVN.
