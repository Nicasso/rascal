.Description

Rascal can generate various kinds of errors:

*  <<Static Errors>> are discovered before the programs is executed.
*  <<Dynamic Errors>> are discovered during execution of the Rascal program; some are execptions that can be caught by they Rascal program.

but we are moving to a situation where static errors will be discovered before execution.
