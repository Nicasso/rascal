.Description
Suppose you are a book editor and want to ensure that all chapter
and section titles are properly capitalized. Here is how to do this. 

.Examples
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/common/WordReplacement.rsc[tags=module]
----

                
<1> We start by introducing a helper function `capitalize` that does the actual capitalization of a single word.
    See link:/Rascal#Patterns-Regular[Regular Pattern] for details about regular expression patterns.
    Next we give two versions of a capitalization functions for a sentence:

<2> `capAll1` uses a while loop to find subsequent words and to replace them by a capitalized version.
<3> `capAll2` uses a [Rascal:Visit] to visit all words in the sentence and replace them by a capitalized version.


Here are some examples:

[source,rascal-shell]
----
import demo::common::WordReplacement;
capitalize("rascal");
capAll1("turn this into a capitalized title")
capAll2("turn this into a capitalized title")
