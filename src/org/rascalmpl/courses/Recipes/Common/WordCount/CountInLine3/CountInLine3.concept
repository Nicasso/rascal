We use a link:/Rascal#Expressions-Reducer[reducer] that is a recipe to reduce the values produced by one or more generators
  to a single value:
  
* `0` is the initial value of the reducer
*  The pattern match `/\w+/ := S` matches all words in `S`.
*  Reduction is done by `it + 1`. In the latter `it` is a keyword that refers to the
   value that has been reduced sofar. Effectively, the matches are reduced to a match count.


Let's try it:
