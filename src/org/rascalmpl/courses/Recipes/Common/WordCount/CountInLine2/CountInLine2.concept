The pattern `/^\W*<word:\w+><rest:.*$>/` can be understood as follows:

*  The `^` makes it _anchored_, only matches at the begin of the substring `S`.
*  `\W*` matches zero or more non-word characters.
*  `<word:\w+>` matches one or more word characters and assigns the result to the variable `word`.
*  `<rest:.*$>` matches the remaining part of `S`.


Inside the loop `count` is incremented and the new value of `S` becomes
the remainder of the current match. To summarize: each iteration
removes the first word from `S` and counts it.
