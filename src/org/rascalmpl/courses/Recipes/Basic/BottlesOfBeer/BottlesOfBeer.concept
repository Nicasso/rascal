.Examples
Here is our version:
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/basic/Bottles.rsc[tags=module]
----

                
<1> We use an auxiliary function `bottles` that returns the word "bottle" adjusted for the actual number of bottles that is available.
Observe how we use the patterns `0`, `1` and `int n` in the definition of three variants of this function.

<2> _Pattern-directed invocation_ (see link:/Rascal#Declarations-Function[function declaration]) will determine at the call site which function will be called. The
general case is labeled with `default` to indicate that if the case for 0 and 1 do not match, this alternative should handle the other cases. 

<3> The main function is `sing` that iterates over the numbers 99 downto 1 (as described by the range `[99 .. 1]`)
and prints appriopriate lyrics. Observe how the value  of the `bottles` function is interpolated several times in the string.

Here is the result:

[source,rascal-shell]
----
import demo::basic::Bottles;
sing();
