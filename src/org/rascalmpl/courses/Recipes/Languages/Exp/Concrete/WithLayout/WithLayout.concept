.Description

In Rascal, the major difference between lexical syntax and non-lexical syntax is that:

* Strings that are parsed according to the lexical syntax __do not__ contain additional layout characters
  such as spaces, new lines, and source code comments.
* Strings that are parsed according to the normal (non-lexical) syntax __can__ contain layout characters between
  each element. 
* Which 'layout' (whitespace and/or source code comments) will be accepted has to be defined explicitly by the grammar writer.


The following example extends the grammar for `Exp` in <<No Layout>> with a layout definition:
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/lang/Exp/Concrete/WithLayout/Syntax.rsc[tags=module]
----

<1> Using the `layout` definition, we defcoine that the `Whitespace` non-terminal is used _in between every symbol_ of the `syntax` productions in the current module.

And now we can use spaces in our definition of the eval function as well:
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/lang/Exp/Concrete/WithLayout/Eval.rsc[tags=module]
----

Note that link:/Rascal#Concepts-PatternMatching[Pattern Matching] will _ignore_ all trees in layout positions, such that the parse tree of "1 + \\n1" will match against `<Exp e1> + <Exp e2>`. The same goes for equality on parse trees.

For the above example Rascal will insert the `Whitespace` non-terminal between every element of the syntax rules for `Exp`.
Moreover, for the start production (See <<No Layout>>) `Whitespace` will be added before and after the `Exp`.

.Examples

The effect of the layout definition is that before parser generation the following grammar is derived for `Exp`:
[source,rascal]
----
syntax Exp 
  = IntegerLiteral          
  | bracket "(" Whitespace Exp Whitespace ")"     
  > left Exp Whitespace "*" Whitespace Exp        
  > left Exp Whitespace "+" Whitespace Exp        
  ;

syntax start[Exp] = Whitespace Exp top Whitespace;
----

To put this all to the test:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
import demo::lang::Exp::Concrete::WithLayout::Syntax;
import demo::lang::Exp::Concrete::WithLayout::Eval;
eval("2 +  3");
eval("2   +  3*4");
eval("( 2+3 )* 4");
----

.Benefits

.Pitfalls

*  If the grammar for `Exp` would contain an optional symbol, as in `syntax Exp = Exp "+"? Exp`, then it would be ambiguous. Does a space in "1 1", belong to the `Whitespace` before or after the missing `+`? To disambiguate the `layout` definition should be changed to `layout Whitespace = [\ \t\n\r]* !>> [\ \t\n\r]`. That will make sure the space goes with the first Whitespace, because even an empty Whitespace list must never be followed immediately by a space.
