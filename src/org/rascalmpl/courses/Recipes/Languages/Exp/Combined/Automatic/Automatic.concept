.Description

link:/Libraries#ParseTree-implode[implode] is a function that automates the mapping between parse trees and abstract syntax trees.
It takes two arguments:

*  The _reified_ type of the desired abstract syntax. (In Rascal, types can not be used freely as values.
  A reified type, is a type that is wrapped in such a way that it can be passed as an argument to a function.)
*  The parse tree to be converted.


`implode` is smart in trying to find a mapping, but it needs some guidance.
A necessary step is therefore to label the rules in the grammar with the name of the 
constructor to which it has to be mapped.

.Examples
Let's first label the syntax rules of the Exp grammar with constructor names:
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/lang/Exp/Combined/Automatic/Syntax.rsc[tags=module]
----
            
Observe that at image:{images}/1.png[], image:{images}/2.png[] and image:{images}/3.png[] these labels have been added.

It is good practice to introduce separate modules for parsing and for the conversion itself:

*  A `Parse` module defines a parse function and returns a parse tree. It imports only the concrete syntax.
*  A `Load` module defines a load function that first calls the above `parse` function and then applies `implode` to it.
  This is the only module that imports both concrete and abstract syntax at the same time and is therefore the only place to be
  concerned about name clashes. (If I mention `Exp`, do you know which one I mean?).


Here is the `Parse` module for Exp ...
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/lang/Exp/Combined/Automatic/Parse.rsc[tags=module]
----

and this is how it works:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
import demo::lang::Exp::Combined::Automatic::Parse;
parseExp("2+3*4");
----

We can use `parse` to define `load`:
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/lang/Exp/Combined/Automatic/Load.rsc[tags=module]
----

Notes:

<1> We also need the `parse` function, as defined above.
<2> We also need the abstract syntax as already defined earlier in [Exp/Abstract].
<3> We need [Rascal:ParseTree] since it provides the [Rascal:implode] function.


Let's try it:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
import demo::lang::Exp::Combined::Automatic::Load;
load("2+3*4");
----

Remains the definition of the `eval` function:
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/lang/Exp/Combined/Automatic/Eval.rsc[tags=module]
----

                
Here is the end result:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
import demo::lang::Exp::Combined::Automatic::Eval;
eval("2+3*4");
----
