.Description
There are several aspects of the runtime representation of Lisp programs and Lisp data
that have to be described:

*  The representation of values (see `Lval` below).
*  The handling of the _scope_ of variables (see `Scope`, `Env`, `makeEnv` and `find` below).
*  The way the interpreter returns its results (see `Result` below).

<1> The data type `Lval` takes care of the representation of Lisp values.
    It covers integers, atoms, lists and closures (the representation of a functions and
    the context in which it will be executed).

<2> A `Scope` describes the binding of several related variables to their value.
    Since scopes may be nested, an environment (`Env`) consisted of a list of scope.
   The most inner scope is at the start of the list and the most global one at the end.

<3> Creating a new scope is done by `makeEnv` which takes a list of variables
    (represented by `Lval`s, in most cases this will be an atom like `Atom("X")`),
    a list of values and creates a new scope in front of the current environment.

<4> The function `find` tries to locate the scope in which a name was previously defined.
    It searches the nested scopes inside-out and returns the _index_ in the given environment
   of the scope in which the name is defined, or `-1` if it is not found.

<5> We define useful constants for true and false (the atoms `#t` and `#f`, respectively).

<6> Finally, we define `Result` as a tuple of an `Lval` and an `Env`.
    Each step during interpretation will thus return the value it computed and
    a possibly modified environment.
