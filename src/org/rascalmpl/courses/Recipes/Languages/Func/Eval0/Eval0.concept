.Description

Interpreter Eval0 supports the following features of Func:


|====
| Feature              | Eval0

| function declaration | y
| integer constant     | y
| variable             | y
| arithmetic operators | y
| comparison operators | y
| call                 | y
| if                   | y
| let                  |
| sequence             |
| assignment           |
| address operator     |
| dereference operator |

.Examples

Here is the code for Eval0:
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/lang/Func/Eval0.rsc[tags=module]

Some points to note:

<1> `PEnv` is used as an alias for a map from names to functions. Such maps are used to represent the function definitions in the program.
<2> Here the top level interpreter `eval0` is defined. It takes the name of the main function, a list of actual parameters, and the complete Func program. Binding of variables is done by substitution.
<3> The substitution function is defined. It takes an expression, a list of variables, and a list of integer values to be substituted for them. Note how a [Rascal:Visit] is used to find all the variables in the expression and to replace them.
<4> The versions of `eval0` for each implemented construct. They all have a `PEnv` argument that is needed
    to resolve calls.
<5> The if expression is defined: the then-branch is taken when the test evaluates to a non-zero integer.
<6> The call expression is interpreted. It contains the following steps:
    **  The actual parameters are evaluated.
    **  A substitution is made in the body of the called function, replacing formal parameters by actual values.
    **  The result of this substitution is evaluated.


Let's try this on example `F0`:
[source,rascal]
----
include::{LibDir}demo/lang/Func/programs/F0.func[]
----

                
[source,rascal-shell]
----
import demo::lang::Func::Load;
import demo::lang::Func::Eval0;
import demo::lang::Func::programs::F0;
eval0("fact", [10], load(F0));
